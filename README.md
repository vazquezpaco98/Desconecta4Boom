# Desconecta4Boom
 
This project is an academic practise for the subject Artificial Intelligence, that I coursed in UGR.

Most of the code is provided by the teachers. The idea was to create by ourselves a behaivour for the player.

## Rules

The game is very simple, is a four in a row but reversed. The player that wins is the last to reach 4 consecutive circles.
